**Get This!** is a web application that uses Node.js and Express to handle the server and route requests, and axios to send those requests.  The app allows users to save things they may find online that they want to purchase and then easily return to the URL from the item when the time comes.  You can keep your list up to date by marking the items you've already purchased which will add them to another list of "purchased" items.  Also, if you no longer need something, just delete it.  

Tech Stack: 
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript 
- Node.js
- Express
- Axios

*Also incorporates a npm package called unfurl.js to handle the scraping of metadata to get images and descriptions of items saved*
